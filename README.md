 Specification curve in Stata


Hi, 

the "file spec_curve.do" shows how you can create  a specification curve (like the one below) in Stata.

The example uses the auto dataset in Stata. 

I created a small function to store estimates, but created the chart manually based on the stored estimates. 

You are very welcome to use the code, change it, suggest improvements etc. You do not need to give me credit, but be kind to someone today.

Best,
Hans
